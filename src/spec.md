# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a footer call-to-action after the apology letter that lets Radhika click a button to play the attached video in-page.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a new footer section at the end of the letter card (below the existing sign-off) with a short English line saying you’re not angry and asking her to click the button.
- Add a prominent, mobile-friendly button in the footer that opens an in-page video player (inline or modal) and plays the provided local static video without navigating away.
- Style the new footer/message/button/video player to match the existing cute romantic pastel theme and keep it responsive, with no added credits/branding.

**User-visible outcome:** After reading the letter, Radhika will see a short message and a button; tapping it plays the attached video in-page, and she can close/pause it and return to the letter without reloading.
